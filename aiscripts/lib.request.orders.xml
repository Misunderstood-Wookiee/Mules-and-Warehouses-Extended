<!-- 
Whenever a ship tries to obtain "initial" orders...
1. Because it has just been freshly constructed (NOT OUR MAIN POINT)
2. Because it has just received a new assignment
Do:
1. Check if it is a ship-to-station assignment (passively checked as a result of original code structure)
2. Check if it is running one of our Mules command
3. If [2] returns true, protect the Mules and exempt them from getting the station assignment AutoTrade.
Note:
Requires the MD file in the other folder to work properly.
Effect:
Now possible to assign Mules to station with assignment="assignment.trade" while still retaining the Mules order.

            $object: the ship; could be running a Mule
            $object.defaultorder.id: the id of the default order; e.g. if $object is running DistriMule, this property will be 'DistriMule' 
                                     as per the id attribute from /aiscripts/distrib_mule.xml

            In X4, a non-zero value will be evaluated to be TRUE.

            Overall, this has the effect of checking if the ship is running our Mules command
